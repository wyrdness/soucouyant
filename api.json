      "full": "The **Soucouyant** (also spelled *Soucouyan*, *Soucriant*) is one of the most terrifying and enduring figures in Caribbean folklore—a vampire witch who sheds her skin at night, transforms into a ball of fire, and soars through the darkness seeking victims to drain of blood. By day, she appears as an old woman living at the margins of society. By night, she hides her skin, becomes a fireball, and enters homes through any opening to suck blood from sleeping victims, particularly children. If her skin is found and salted, she cannot return to human form and will burn to death at sunrise. The Soucouyant represents a powerful fusion of **West African vampire traditions** brought to the Caribbean by enslaved peoples, merged with **European folklore** (particularly French *loup-garou* beliefs) and **indigenous Caribbean spirituality**. She embodies themes of female power, aging, social ostracism, cultural memory, and the enduring legacy of the African diaspora."
