      "summary": "A Caribbean vampire witch of African diaspora origin that sheds her skin at night, transforms into a ball of fire, and flies through the darkness seeking victims to drain of blood. Found primarily in Trinidad and Tobago folklore with variants across the Caribbean.",
      "full": "The Soucouyant is one of the most feared supernatural entities in Caribbean folklore, representing a complex fusion of African, European, and indigenous Caribbean beliefs. By day, she appears as an old woman, often living at the margins of society. By night, she removes her skin, hides it, and transforms into a fireball that soars through the sky. The Soucouyant enters homes through any opening to suck blood from sleeping victims, leaving bruises or mysterious wounds. Originating from West African vampire traditions brought by enslaved peoples and merging with French and Spanish folklore, the Soucouyant embodies themes of female power, aging, social ostracism, and the legacy of colonialism. Protection methods include salt, rice grains (which she must count), and garlic. If her hidden skin is found and salted, she cannot return to human form and will die at sunrise."
